! The default hello timer is 3 seconds and the hold timer is 10 seconds
! A Router is elected as Active Virtual Gateway (AVG), and it as the 
! responsable to answer the ARP Request from the Host

! Maximum 4 Routers could be elected as AVF Active Virtual Forwarder (AVF), 
! and they are the responsable to forward the trafic from the hosts. The other

! ############### FHRP for IPv6
! IPv6 have a native FHRP implemented based on the ICMP Route Advertisement
! that permit infor the host about all the router availables as a Default 
! Gateway. The host will choose a router as active and if it fail, it could use
! the other routers available
! The main problem with this method is that there are not tracking mechanism 
! available and the failover time is arround 40 seconds, that too long

! The other option is to use DHCPv6 that could provide the redundant routers 
! available, but even this method is not too usefull

! For that reason is usefull use the IPv6 version of the FHRP available, as 
! HSRPv2, GLBP and VRRP. The main diference is that Link-Local address is used 
! as DG, the Virtual IP address must be IPv6 and use IPv6 multicast address to
! send the control messages, like FF02::66 (HSRPv2/GLBP) and FF02::12 (VRRP)

(config-if)# standby 10 ip 2000::1

! Another option to gnerate the IP is using the autoconfig option available 
! for IPv6 that generate that the IPv6 have the EUI-64 option. This address 
! will be share via the FHRP from the active router to the other routers

(config-if)# standby 10 ip autoconfig

! When FHRP is configured, the ICMP Route Solicitation (RS) message from the 
! Host will be responded whit the Virtual IP address configured or auto 
! generated 

! -----------------------------
! ############### Port Security
! Port Security Feauture protect against attacks like MAC Flooding that could
! produce CAM Table Overflow, that produce that all the other (legitimate) MAC 
! address could no be record and then all packet must be flooded, and as 
! result all trafic will be forwarded even to the attacker machine

! To control this, port-security pert limit the amount of MAC addresses that 
! could be learned and forwarded via a port

! To enable port security the port must be configure statically as ACCESS port

(config-if)# switchport mode access

! -------------------------------
! ############### Protected VLANs
! A protected port does not forward any data traffic to any other port that is also 
! a protected port; only control traffic, such as PIM packets, is forwarded because 
! these packets are processed by the CPU and forwarded in software
! All data traffic passing between protected ports must be forwarded through a 
! Layer 3 device

! -----------------------------
! ############### Private VLANs

! The primary VLAN carries traffic from the promiscuous ports to the host ports, 
! both isolated and community, and to other promiscuous ports.

! An isolated VLAN is a secondary VLAN that carries unidirectional traffic upstream 
! from the hosts toward the promiscuous ports. You can configure multiple isolated 
! VLANs in a private VLAN domain; all the traffic remains isolated within each one.
! Each isolated VLAN can have several isolated ports, and the traffic from each 
! isolated port also remains completely separate.

! A community VLAN is a secondary VLAN that carries upstream traffic from the 
! community ports to the promiscuous port and to other host ports in the same 
! community. You can configure multiple community VLANs in a private VLAN domain 
! The ports within one community can communicate, but these ports cannot communicate 
! with ports in any other community or isolated VLAN in the private VLAN

! ############### DHCP Snooping

! Validates DHCP messages received from untrusted sources and filters out invalid 
! messages. Rate-limits DHCP traffic from trusted and untrusted sources. Builds and 
! maintains the DHCP snooping binding database, which contains information about 
! untrusted hosts with leased IP addresses. Utilizes the DHCP snooping binding 
! database to validate subsequent requests from untrusted hosts. 

! The feature adds an entry to the database when the switch receives a DHCPACK 
! message from the server. The feature removes the entry in the database when the IP 
! address lease expires or the switch receives a DHCPRELEASE message from the host. 

! Each entry in the DHCP snooping binding database includes the MAC address of the 
! host, the leased IP address, the lease time, the binding type, and the VLAN number 
! and interface information associated with the host

! Other security features, such as dynamic ARP inspection (DAI), also use 
! information stored in the DHCP snooping binding database

! An untrusted source may initiate traffic attacks or other hostile actions. To 
! prevent such attacks, the DHCP snooping feature filters messages and rate-limits 
! traffic from untrusted sources. Host ports are generally treated as untrusted 
! sources.

! You must configure DHCP server interfaces as trusted. You can also configure other 
! interfaces as trusted if they connect to devices (such as switches or routers) 
! inside your network

(config)# ip dhcp snooping
(config)# ip dhcp snooping information option
! Enables DHCP option-82 data insertion
(config)# ip dhcp snooping verify mac-address
! Enables DHCP snooping MAC address verification

(config)# ip dhcp snooping vlan 10-12,20
! Enables DHCP snooping on a VLAN or VLAN range

(config-if)# ip dhcp snooping trust
! The default trust state of all interfaces is untrusted
(config-if)# ip dhcp snooping limit rate 100
! Configures DHCP packet rate limiting

# show ip dhcp snooping

! To retain the bindings across reloads, you must use the DHCP snooping database 
! agent. Without this agent, the bindings established by DHCP snooping are lost upon 
! reload, and connectivity is lost as well

! The database agent stores the bindings in a file at a configured location. Upon 
! reload, the switch reads the file to build the database for the bindings. The 
! switch keeps the file current by writing to the file as the database changes

(config)# ip dhcp snooping database tftp://10.1.1.1/directory/file

# show ip dhcp snooping database detail
! Displays the DHCP snooping database agent statistics

# renew ip dhcp snooping data tftp://10.1.1.1/directory/file
! Directs the switch to read the file from the URL
# clear ip dhcp snooping database statistics
! Clears the statistics associated with the database agent

# ip dhcp snooping binding 1.1.1 vlan 1 1.1.1.1 interface gi1/1 expiry 1000
! Adds the binding using the ip dhcp snooping exec command
# show ip dhcp snooping binding
! Verifies whether the bindings were read successfully

! ############### Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)

! Dynamic ARP inspection is a security feature that validates ARP packets in a 
! network. It intercepts, logs, and discards ARP packets with invalid IP-to-MAC 
! address bindings. 

! DAI is an ingress security feature; it does not perform any egress checking
! DAI is supported on access ports, trunk ports, EtherChannel ports, and private 
! VLAN ports

! This capability protects the network from certain man-in-the-middle attacks. 
! Dynamic ARP inspection ensures that only valid ARP requests and responses are 
! relayed. 

! The switch performs these activities:
! Intercepts all ARP requests and responses on untrusted ports Verifies that each of 
! these intercepted packets has a valid IP-to-MAC address binding before updating 
! the local ARP cache or before forwarding the packet to the appropriate destination.
! Drops invalid ARP packets Dynamic ARP inspection determines the validity of an ARP 
! packet based on valid IP-to-MAC address bindings stored in a trusted database, the 
! DHCP snooping binding database.

! This database is built by DHCP snooping if DHCP snooping is enabled on the VLANs 
! and on the switch. If the ARP packet is received on a trusted interface, the 
! switch forwards the packet without any checks. 

(config)# ip arp inspection vlan 10-12,15

# show ip arp inspection vlan 10-12,15

! On untrusted interfaces, the switch forwards the packet only if it is valid. To 
! ensure network reachability to the server, configure a static DHCP snooping 
! binding entry on the switch.

! Packets arriving on trusted interfaces bypass all DAI validation checks, and those 
! arriving on untrusted interfaces undergo the DAI validation process

(config-if)# ip arp inspection trust

# show ip arp inspection interfaces

! The switch performs DAI validation checks, which rate limits incoming ARP packets 
! to prevent a denial-of-service attack. By default, the rate for untrusted 
! interfaces is 15 packets per second (pps). Trusted interfaces are not rate limited

(config-if)# ip arp inspection limit rate 20 burst interval 2 

# show ip arp inspection interfaces

! When the switch drops a packet, it places an entry in the log buffer and then 
! generates system messages on a rate-controlled basis. After the message is 
! generated, the switch clears the entry from the log buffer

(config)# ip arp inspection log-buffer entries 64 

# show ip arp inspection log

(config)# errdisable recovery cause arp-inspection
! Enables DAI error-disabled recovery
